# Minimum Operations Recursive Function

## Overview

The `minOperations` recursive function calculates the minimum number of operations needed to reach a target number `n` using a recursive approach. This function can be used to solve problems where you want to find the minimum number of steps to reach a specific goal.

## Function Description

### `minOperations(n)`

Calculates the minimum number of operations needed to reach a target number `n`.

#### Parameters

- `n` (int): The target number.

#### Returns

- `int`: The minimum number of operations needed to reach `n`.

#### Example

```
from min_operations import minOperations

n = 9
result = minOperations(n)
print(f"Minimum operations to achieve {n}: {result}")
```

## How It Works

1. The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is 1 or less, it returns 0 because it's impossible to achieve `n` with fewer than 2 operations.

2. The function enters a loop that iterates from `op = 2` to `n`. This loop checks for operations that can reduce `n`.

3. For each `op`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `op`. If it is, it recursively calls `minOperations(int(n / op))` and adds `op` to the result. This step is crucial for breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

4. The recursion continues until it reaches the base case (when `n` is 1 or less), and then it starts returning results back up the call stack.

5. The final result is the minimum number of operations needed to reach the target `n`.

## Requirements

- Python 3
